**Pokémon Pokédex & Cards**
-

This project is to create an application to solve a real-world problem, we decided to create a Pokémon Pokédex to help enthusiasts of the franchise search for information on the pokémon they want to know more about and show pokémon cards related to their search, we decided to use the CSS framework FOUNDATION for this appplication but due to some difficulties we had to change our CSS framework to BULMA. 

Project Requirements:
-
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

- Use at least two server-side APIs.

- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Be responsive.

- Have a polished UI.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
